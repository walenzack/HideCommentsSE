# HideCommentsSE
A simple userscript for hiding comments on StackExchange sites.

Comments are a great way of interacting with other SE users, asking for clarifications and pointing out enhancements.  
On the other hand, comments can also initiate endless and pointless discussions, be used for offtopic chit-chat, be distracting and even outright offensive.
Hence why most high-volume SE sites work so hard on applying strict comment policies, encouraging users to use the chat instead, and to post new answers instead of negatively commenting on existing ones.

If you feel like comments make your SE experience less productive or less enjoyable, but "just ignoring them" is not working, try this userscript.

NOTE: You'll need a userscript browser extension like Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, etc. to use it.
